# AirUBC
AirUBC is a flight reservation system for domestic flights in Canada. Through AirUBC, a potential passenger can make a number of transactions (uniquely defined by their transaction ID), or reserve/cancel tickets for scheduled dates. A transaction has various methods of payment, of which a ticket is then issued by an employee once the transaction goes through successfully. A ticket maintains information of the employee, the transaction that was made and the accompanying flight schedule. The flight schedule is constantly updated with every route having a set destination and departure location across Canada. Airplanes have various models with a limited number of seats, which is also handled through the flight schedule. In a branch, which are located throughout the provinces, are a number of employees who are responsible for issuing tickets to passengers. We also keep track of every employee and passengerâ€™s information such as phone number, date of birth, etc. A transaction can be made between a passenger and an employee, of which a ticket is then issued with its corresponding flight schedule for a specific route the passenger may want to travel.
